## <u>Overview</u>

Hello and welcome to Bored Reviews. Bored Reviews is a is a React app links to an API I previously created and can be found here (<b>[API](https://fe-bored-reviews.herokuapp.com/)</b>).

The app is a board game review site which lets users leave reviews for their favourite board games. Other users can leave comments and vote on the reviews.

This project was built during my time as a student at NorthCoders as part of the front end block of the course. The application was built using React and was styled with CSS and bootstrap-react. Take a look around and any feedback would be greatly appreciated !!

## <u>Learning objectives</u>

This project will provide a practical example of designing, creating and deploying a application using React. The project is aimed at improving my understanding of the following topics;

- Designing a website with the use of wire-frame - for this project Excalidraw was used.
- Creating a react application using npx.
- Designing components, laying them out in an order and accessible structure.
- Using hooks and state within React, to develop a responsive user experience.
- Using props to pass down React states to components.
- Use React-Router-Dom including BrowserRouter, Links, Route and Switch to link components.
- Using CSS and libraries such as Bootstrap-React to style application.
- Deploying a React application on Heroku.

## <u>Local Development Set-up</u>

You can build a dev version of this site using a few simple commands. Please ensure you have Node.js and Git installed on your local machine.

Clone the repo using the below command;

`git clone https://github.com/RicCrankshaw2409/fe-project.git`

Then install the dependencies to your local machine by running the following commands in terminal:

`cd nc-games`
<br></br>
`npm install`

Once installation is complete run the below command to start the application;

`npm start`

It will automatically load the website to your default browser, or you can manually access it by visiting localhost:3000.

Enjoy !
